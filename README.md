# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [SB Admin 2](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/)

[SB Admin 2](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/) is an open source, admin dashboard template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Getting Started

To begin using this template, choose one of the following options to get started:
* [Download the latest release on Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/)
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2.git`
* Fork the repo

## Using the Source Files

After cloning the repo take a look at the `gulpfile.js` and check out the tasks available:
* `gulp` The default task will compile the LESS and JS into the `dist` directory and minify the output, and it will copy all vendor libraries from `bower_components` into the `vendor` directory
* `gulp dev` The dev task will serve up a local version of the template and will watch the LESS, JS, and HTML files for changes and reload the browser windo automatically

To update dependencies, run `bower update` and then run `gulp copy` to copy the updated dependencies into the `vendor` directory

This is tiny implementation of highly configurable gauge using pure JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.
No dependencies. Suitable for IoT devices because of minimum code base.

## Installation

Canvas gauges can be simply installed using npm package manager. Depending on your needs there is possibility to install whole gauge library or only that part you really need for your project.
To install the whole library, run:

    $ npm install canvas-gauges

If you only need the exact type of the gauge it can be installed using the appropriate npm tag. Currently the following gauges are supported: linear, radial.

To install only linear gauge, run:

    $ npm install canvas-gauges@linear

To install only radial gauge, run:

    $ npm install canvas-gauges@radial

This strategy useful only if you need to minimize your code base and plan to use ONLY a specific gauge type. If you need to use various gauge types in your project it is recommended to use whole gauge package.
